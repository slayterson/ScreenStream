I'd be happy to guide you through creating an intrusion detection system (IDS) for Windows 11. However, building a full-fledged AI-powered IDS requires significant development and expertise. I'll provide a basic outline and some code snippets to get you started.
Option 1: Local Machine (Windows 11)
To create a local IDS, you can use Windows Event Logs and Python. We'll use the win32evtlog library to access event logs and scapy for network packet analysis.
Required Libraries:
pywin32 (for Windows Event Logs)
scapy (for network packet analysis)
pyshark (optional, for network packet capture)
Basic Code:
Python
import win32evtlog
from scapy.all import *

# Set up event log monitoring
server = 'localhost'
log_handle = win32evtlog.OpenEventLog(server, 'Security')

# Define a function to process event logs
def process_event_log(record):
    # Analyze the event log record
    if record.EventID == 4624:  # Login attempt
        print(f"Login attempt: {record.StringInserts[0]}")

# Define a function to capture network packets
def capture_packets(packet):
    # Analyze the packet
    if packet.haslayer(IP) and packet.haslayer(TCP):
        print(f"TCP packet: {packet[IP].src} -> {packet[IP].dst}")

# Start monitoring event logs
while True:
    records = win32evtlog.ReadEventLog(log_handle, win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_FORWARD_READ|win32evtlog.EVENTLOG_SEQUENTIAL_READ, 0)
    if records:
        for record in records:
            process_event_log(record)

# Start capturing network packets (optional)
# sniff(prn=capture_packets, store=False)
This code snippet monitors Windows Event Logs for login attempts and captures network packets using scapy.
Option 2: Remote Machine
To create a remote IDS, you'll need to set up a server to collect and analyze logs and network packets. You can use a framework like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Splunk.
For a Python-based solution, you can use paramiko for remote SSH access and scapy for network packet capture.
Required Libraries:
paramiko (for remote SSH access)
scapy (for network packet capture)
Basic Code:
Python
import paramiko
from scapy.all import *

# Set up remote SSH connection
ssh = paramiko.SSHClient()
ssh.set_missing_host_key_policy(paramiko.AutoAddPolicy())
ssh.connect('remote_machine_ip', username='username', password='password')

# Define a function to collect event logs
def collect_event_logs():
    stdin, stdout, stderr = ssh.exec_command('powershell Get-WinEvent -LogName Security')
    # Process the event logs
    for line in stdout:
        print(line.strip())

# Define a function to capture network packets
def capture_packets(packet):
    # Analyze the packet
    if packet.haslayer(IP) and packet.haslayer(TCP):
        print(f"TCP packet: {packet[IP].src} -> {packet[IP].dst}")

# Start collecting event logs
while True:
    collect_event_logs()

# Start capturing network packets (optional)
# sniff(prn=capture_packets, store=False)
This code snippet collects Windows Event Logs from a remote machine using paramiko and captures network packets using scapy.
AI-powered Intrusion Detection
To take this to the next level, you can integrate machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow to analyze the collected data and detect anomalies.
Required Libraries:
scikit-learn or TensorFlow (for machine learning)
Basic Code:
Python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Assume you have a dataset of normal network traffic
normal_traffic = ...

# Train an Isolation Forest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.1)
model.fit(normal_traffic)

# Define a function to detect anomalies
def detect_anomalies(packet):
    # Extract features from the packet
    features = ...
    # Predict anomaly score
    anomaly_score = model.decision_function([features])
    if anomaly_score < 0:
        print(f"Anomaly detected: {packet}")
This code snippet trains an Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in network traffic.
These are just basic examples to get you started. Building a robust IDS requires significant development, testing, and tuning. You may want to consider using existing IDS solutions like Snort or Suricata.
